# Instructions here for PHP 5.6 upgrade
# https://www.tecmint.com/install-php-5-6-on-centos-7/

# This wasn't needed
# yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

# This installed, but wasn't needed either I think
# yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm

# I think this just lets me run a command to enable a repo
# yum install yum-utils

# 3. One of the most important program provided by yum-utils is yum-config-manager, which you can use to active Remi repository as the
# default repository for installing various PHP versions. For example, if you want to install PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 or PHP 7.2 on
# CentOS 7, just enable it and install as shown.

# This can be done with a template
# yum-config-manager --enable remi-php72   [Install PHP 7.2]

# If you upgrade then I think patching will probably do this, I think apache needs a restart though
# yum install php php-mcrypt php-cli php-gd php-curl php-mysql php-ldap php-zip php-fileinfo
