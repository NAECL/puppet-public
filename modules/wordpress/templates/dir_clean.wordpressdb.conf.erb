#				deletion/compression must be absolute pathname
#
# mask			-	The wildcard which all files will have to match
#				to be deleted/compressed
#
# age			-	The number of days old files will have to be to
#				be deleted/compressed (0 means all files)
#
# action 		-	Consists of either a, c, d, e or D for archive,
#				compress, delete, execute or Directory delete as
#				well as r for recurse
#
# no archived		-	Only if the action string is a, archives the

#				specified command on each matching file

#				containing a pid while a normal string specifies
#				a process name (process name feature is platform
#				specific and has not yet been developed for this
#				platform)
