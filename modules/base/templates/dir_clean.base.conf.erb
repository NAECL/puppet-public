# 
# <root_dir> <mask> <age> <action> <no archived/command> <archive action> <proc>
#
# root_dir		-	The top directory from which to start the
#				deletion/compression must be absolute pathname
#
# mask			-	The wildcard which all files will have to match
#				to be deleted/compressed
#
# age			-	The number of days old files will have to be to
#				be deleted/compressed (0 means all files)
#
# action 		-	Consists of either a, c, d, e or D for archive,
#				compress, delete, execute or Directory delete as
#				well as r for recurse
#
# no archived		-	Only if the action string is a, archives the
#				logfile and adds a number suffix to the end
#
# command		-	Only if the action string is e, runs the
#				specified command on each matching file
#				(command must not have arguments)
#
# archive action	-	Can be c, k or both. c tells to create a new
#				file, k tells to kill -1 a process (Unix only).
#
# proc			-	Unix Only - If k is specified then <proc> gives
#				process to kill. a leading / indicates a file
#				containing a pid while a normal string specifies
#				a process name (process name feature is platform
#				specific and has not yet been developed for this
#				platform)
#
# <root_dir> <mask> <age> <action> <no archived/command> <archive action> <proc>
